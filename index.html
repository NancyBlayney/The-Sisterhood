				<h3>~Empowering girls to be future technology leaders~</h3>
				<p>
					Hello World! TechGirlz empowers middle school girls to become tomorrow's technology leaders. We put tech directly in their hands through our free, project based workshops, and aim to eliminate the gender gap by sparking a passion for tech early in girls' lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to reducing - and, we hope, ultimately eliminating - the gender gap in technology occupations.

					Tech Girlz has many different orgaizations in cities across the conuntry that all work to achieve one common goal - ensuring that girls understand that technology is not a gendered interest. Female exposure to technology can be limited through marketing, the media, and even well-meaning adults. We at Tech Girlz attempt to undo lifetime's of socialization and pressure.

					We have teams specially trained to connect with girls on a professional and personal level. The contact with female mentors within the technology world has a positive influence on young women, which is correlated with improvement and interest in technology. Or, in laymans terms, you can't become what you can't see!

					We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to reducing - and, we hope, ultimately eliminating - the gender gap in technology occupations. We hold workshops and an annual entrepreneurial summer camp aimed at giving middle-school girls hands-on experience with different kinds of technology and enable them to interact with women who have carved out successful careers in technology fields.

					As illustrated in the MIT study included below and many more to be found online, diversity improves performance, morale, and the end product. More women engineers means building a better Internet, and improving software that can service society as a whole. Building a better Internet is why I started doing software development in the first place. I think we can all agree this is of utmost importance.
