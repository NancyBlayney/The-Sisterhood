		 	After killing Sirius Black with a well-aimed Stunning Spell, Bellatrix Lestrange left magic behind for good. She had her wand snapped in half by the proper authorities and started on a long journey of self-discovery. She discovered a love for technology after attending a "GIRLS CODE IT" workshop hosted by a group of young witches in Diagon Alley. Since then, Bellatrix has worked in the IT departments of organizations such as Comcast, BP, and the Bush White House. She hopes to use her technology powers only for evil.
